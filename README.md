The project Moveo is a copy of BlaBlaCar, an existing platform in Europe that makes low-cost trips possible by allowing people to share vehicles with the driver getting a commission from the total trip cost.

The "Descubre m√°s" button redirects to a secondary page.

The project isn't finished yet; 
it was designed to apply grid systems different CSS variables media queries and the use of various colors and font weights.
The idea is also to work with images and make them adaptable to different devices.

The Dev branch has all the code because I'm still working on it.


###  STACK  ### 

I used HTML, my own CSS, a library called "universe.io," frameworks like "Bootstrap," and JavaScript.
